        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>I started programming in Aug 2013, and before that <p class="text-danger">"I HATED OOPS".</p></p>
        <p>But since then, I have played around with low level C stuff in systems programming, wrote tons of C++ console applications, have done quite a lot of Android and Web dev with SQL and NoSQL DBs, have written many scipts for some tedious tasks and also have written a basic multithreaded routing protocol in C++.</p>
        <p>So I can definitely say, <p class="text-success">"I love PROGRAMMING"</p>The best part of coding is the feeling of ecstacy after you have successfully debugged an annoying bug and finshed a problem.</p>

        <p>Apart from this, I am a huge Android Fanboy, I'm a senior member on <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/member.php?u=4443177" target="_blank">XDA</a>.</p>
        <p>And as my twitter status says: 
        <p class="text-info">"Chelsea FC, Rafael Nadal, Indian Cricket Team: Passion cum Obsession cum Religion"</p>
        <p>Love to watch Football (soccer), Tennis, Cricket, F1, NBA/NFL Playoffs and Darts, yes DARTS!</p>
        <p>Love to Swim, play football and cricket</p>
